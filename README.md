# tk1-opencv
jetson tk1 opencv binary repo
These deb packages where built for jetson tk1 with cuda enabled.
They do not include the cpu optimizations available in opencv4tegra, however.
The main difference being, these packages include the gpu module as well as nonfree libraries.
The license for these packages are the same as the standard opencv license
 - and therefore free of charge, for educational use, due to nonfree libs.
